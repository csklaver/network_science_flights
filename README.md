# Network Data Science Final Project
## Making Connections: An Analysis of US Commercial Aviation Networks
- Exploration and analysis of the US commercial airline transportation networks from 1998 to 2018.
- Measured the betweenness, centrality, diameter, and degree using `igraph` library.
- Network visualizations were created using `ggplot2`
- Case study of Southwest Airlines and Delta revealed the differences in growth strategies.
- Found the network to be robust when removing hubs (in the case of COVID-19), but unable to handle the same volume of passengers.
